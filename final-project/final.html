							<p>The Georgia General Assembly proposed the constitutional amendment to create the county on August 17, 1920, and the citizens of the state voted in favor of 
							the amendment on November 2, 1920.[2] Land from Pike County and Monroe County was then transferred to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_County,_Georgia">
							Lamar county</a>. Lamar County was named after Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II.</p>

							<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnesville,_Georgia">Barnesville</em></a> is a city in Lamar County, Georgia, United States. The city 
							is a part of the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 6,755. The city is the county seat of Lamar County. Barnesville 
							was once dubbed the "Buggy Capital of the World" as the town produced about 16,000 buggies a year around the turn of the century.[clarification needed] Each year in 
							the third week of September the town hosts an annual Buggy Days celebration.</p>
							
							<p>Barnesville was founded in 1826 and named for local tavern owner Gideon Barnes. In 1920, Barnesville was designated seat of the newly formed Lamar County.</p>
							
							<p>Barnesville served as a major hospital site for wounded southern troops during the Civil War. Local families took wounded Soldiers into their homes and 
							treated them with highly successful recovery rates. Major General William B. Bate, CSA of Hardees Corps wounded in Atlanta at Utoy Creek 10 August 1864 was 
							treated here. Gen Bate after the war was elected Govenor of Tennessee and served in the United States Senate until his death in 1912. He commented on his 
							successful recovery as a result of the kindness of the local populace in Barnesville.</p>
							
							<p><a href="http://www.gainformer.com/files/First%20African%20American%20Mayor%20of%20Barnesville%20Passes.htm"><em>Dewaine Bell</em></a>, the first African-American 
							mayor in Barnesville, Georgia history, died early Saturday,October 6, 2007 at the Griffin-Spalding County Hospital. Mr. Bell, a cancer survivor, had been 
							battling a recurrence of the disease. His cause of death was gastrointestinal bleeding. "Dewaine Bell was an excellent mayor. He was an outstanding spokesman 
							for Barnesville. He always concentrated on our assets not our blemishes. He never tired of selling Barnesville," city manager Kenny Roberts said. Bell served 
							as band director at Lamar County High School and later as principal. He was elected mayor in 2003 and took office on January 1, 2004. Bell was a gifted 
							musician and one of the founders of the Barnesville BBQ & Blues Festival. He played keyboards and the saxophone in 4U2C, a band he formed some years back. He 
							also performed on the soprano saxophone at weddings and funerals here and throughout Georgia.<p>

					<h3>The Herald Gazette</h3>
						<aside>
							<p><em>The Barnesville News-Gazette</em> was founded by E.T. Pound and Charles Lambdin in 1867. Despite many changes of 
							hands and a merger with the competition, it has published a weekly newspaper since then.</p>
							<p>In 1870, Pound and Lambdin were charging $2 a year for subscriptions; today it is $25, a bargain among local newspapers. 
							Pound and a partner surnamed Beverly were the publishers in 1874, followed by J.C. McMichael in 1878-84 and 1886-87. 
							Henry R. Harris Jr. was the publisher in 1886. Leading the Gazette in 1891 were McMichael and B.H. Hardy, followed by 
							E.N. Mills and a partner named Gordy in 1899. Mills had it by himself in 1902, when Thad Adams became the editor.</p>
							
							<p>Hardy returned to the paper as publisher in 1905, holding the position until 1941. William W. Dennis became publisher 
							in August 1945 and operated the newspaper through 1978 when it was sold to Bob Tribble. It was bought out by the competing 
							Barnesville Herald on Feb. 6, 1980.</p>
							<p>The Barnesville Herald's first location in a house owned by Lamar State Bank on Thomaston Street. It was founded Feb. 7, 
							1979 with Frank Heflin as publisher and Mike Bradford as editor.</p>
							
							<p>The Herald-Gazette came about as a result of the merger between the News-Gazette and the Herald. The newspaper office was 
							located at 19 Market Street in 1980 but moved into new facility on Greenwood Street in 1982 under the ownership of Laura and 
							Walter Geiger, who bought the Herald in March 1979. The building is still in use today.</p>
							
							<p>Under the Geiger’s leadership, The Herald-Gazette became one of the first newspapers to have an online presence, debuting 
							this site in 1996. Having undergone a major overhaul in 2009, the site has become one of the web’s most popular news sites, 
							reaching the milestone of having over one million hits in November 2008.</p>

						<h3>B. Lloyds </h3>
							<p>In 1905, at the age of 6, <em>Mr. B. Lloyd Woodall</em> helped his father plant pecan trees. Twenty-five years later, using pecans from the trees he helped plant, Mr. "B. Lloyd" built his first pecan store near Barnesville, Georgia.</p>
							<p>From this modest beginning, the business expanded rapidly. At one point shortly before World War II, Mr. B. Lloyd was operating 14 stores in the Southeast. Signs reading "B. Lloyd's" were seen up and down Southern highways like US 41 and US 301.</p>
							<p>In 1939, a booth at the World's Fair in New York introduced B. Lloyd's products to millions. Shipments were made to points all over the United States and to servicemen and women overseas.</p>
							<p>In 2002 Heeth Varnedoe, a Thomasville native, and Douglas R. Wedding, from St. Petersburg, Florida, purchased the company. Since then, Varnedoe and Wedding have rapidly expanded production and introduced new products into grocery store shelves, including B. Lloyd's glazed nut salad toppers and ice cream toppers.</p>
