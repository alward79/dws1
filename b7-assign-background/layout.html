        <p> Oz lives in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, with his wife Lisa.[30] They have been married since 1985[31] and have four children. His eldest daughter 
        	is author and television host Daphne Oz. The other three are Arabella, Zoe and Oliver.</p>

        <p> Oz is fluent in English and Turkish.[32] He is a holder of Turkish and American citizenship, having served in the Turkish Army to retain his 
        	Turkish citizenship.[33]</p>
        	
        <p> Oz grew up in a mixed Muslim environment where his father's family were conservatives who believed in the integration of Islam and government, 
        	while his mother's family were more secular Muslims.[34] He has been influenced by the mysticism of Sufi Muslims,[35] as well as the ideas of 
        	Emanuel Swedenborg, the Swedish scientist, philosopher, and Christian theologian.[36] He wrote in Spirituality and Health Magazine in 2010 that 
        	"As I came into contact with Swedenborg's many writings, I began to understand Swedenborg's profound insights and how they applied directly to 
        	my life". He mentions Swedenborg's ideas that marriage lasts to eternity, everyone has a purpose in this world, God is love, and Swedenborg's 
        	answers to "Why do bad things happen?".[37]</p>	
        <p> Oz is a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. "When I meditate, I go to that place where truth lives", he said. "I can see what reality 
         	really is, and it is so much easier to form good relationships then."[38]</p>	
        <p> In August 2010, Oz was diagnosed with a pre-cancerous polyp in the colon during a routine colonoscopy[39] which was performed as part of his 
        	show. Oz said that the procedure likely saved his life.[40]</p>
